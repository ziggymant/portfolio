  <p class="my-4">Hi there! I'm a web developer passionate about creating dynamic and user-friendly digital experiences. My journey in tech is driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving, but beyond the keyboard, I have a variety of interests that fuel my creativity and keep me grounded.
    <br><br>
    In my free time, I’m an avid sports enthusiast, practicing calisthenics, jogging, and skipping to stay fit and energized. I’m also a keen reader, diving into everything from classical literature to finance, economics, and business, constantly seeking new perspectives. Tinkering with hardware and DIY projects is another hobby of mine—I enjoy fixing bikes, working on home renovations, and improving my custom-built PC setups.
    <br><br>
    I have a deep appreciation for nature, which is reflected in my small garden, where I grow plants in a custom-made greenhouse and nurture indoor greenery. I also spend time on my artistic side, practicing live portrait drawing every Sunday as a creative outlet.
    <br><br>
    Investing is a passion of mine as well—I follow the stock market closely, focusing on stock picking and ETFs. I’m also an avid podcast listener, enjoying content that spans topics like science, IT, design, finance, and philosophy.
    <br><br>
    These diverse interests help me stay inspired and balanced, enriching both my personal and professional life.
